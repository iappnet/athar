- ✅ /drift-check gate: 3 failures found and fixed (PR5+PR6 rows, %, CHECKPOINT internal drift)
- ✅ A5 (addendum): VCS policy — blanket `.claude/` ignore replaced with machine-local-only rules; 7 project-memory files now tracked — commit `510cb0a`

## NEXT ACTION

**Deferred QA sweep** runs at end of roadmap, after the last feature PR. No feature PR is gated. Nothing ships to users/TestFlight until sweep passes. Bucket: 5 items (see CURRENT_MIGRATION_STATE.md).  
**AR visual QA:** Calendar dual-display (primaryHijri on/off, dark mode, 5-dot cell, boundary labels) deferred to final device sweep.  
**Stage B:** Do NOT begin until product owner explicitly authorises file moves/renames.
